# Python-Code-Samples
This repository showcases problems 1-7 of the module 3 lab. The programs start off simple and become more involved. You can view a variety of programs, from something simple to printing a message. To programs that can convert Fahrenheit to Celsius. I also learned new operations elements that can be used to ask questions and produce solutions.
